# Documenting anima executables
Currently, there are over 150 executables in anima codebase, most of which
offer little to no documentation when called with the `-h` flag in the
command-line. The objective of this project is to add a minimalistic
description (1-2 sentences) to every executable.

In the meantime, we will also re-organize command-line arguments so that they
appear in this order when the `-h` option is invoked:
- required arguments
- switch arguments
- optional arguments
